# SCREENSHOT_PIPELINE
This GitHub repository provides a comprehensive guide and resources for setting up a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) workflow that generates and updates screenshots of your website's homepage. By automating the process, you can ensure your screenshots are always up to date, making them valuable for your README file, marketing materials, and even visual regression testing.

# Benefits

   - Always Up-to-Date Screenshots: With this CI/CD workflow, you can automatically generate screenshots of your website's homepage whenever changes are made to your codebase. This ensures that the screenshots are always up to date, reflecting the latest design and layout changes.

  -  Improved Documentation and Marketing Materials: Having current screenshots of your homepage allows you to enhance your project's documentation, including your README file. Additionally, these screenshots can be utilized in marketing materials, presentations, or other promotional content to showcase the appearance of your website.

  -  Visual Regression Testing: The generated screenshots can be utilized for visual regression testing. By comparing new screenshots with previous versions, you can easily detect any unintended visual changes caused by code modifications and address them promptly.
